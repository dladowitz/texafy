Here is what you should do to make it work.

1. Add an application.yml file with environmental variables. Figaro is already setup and ready to go.
2. Run `rake db:seed` to create the first user with admin rights.
3. Either commnet out the stripe code or go create new keys and subscription levels. These where copied from Markafy.
5. Update the Project Details sections in `development.rb`, `production.rb` & `test.rb` files
6. All specs are working. Lets keep it that way. (And keep adding more tests).
